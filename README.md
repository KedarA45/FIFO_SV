**FIFO Design in Verilog with SystemVerilog Testbench**

This project implements a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory using Verilog, along with a complete SystemVerilog testbench to verify its functionality.

**Features of the FIFO**

1.32-depth FIFO (fifo[31:0])
2.8-bit data width
3.Independent read and write pointers
4.Full & Empty flag generation
5.Synchronous read and write operations
6.Resettable pointers and output
7.Safe read/write protection using r_en and w_en signals
