FIFO Design in Verilog with SystemVerilog Testbench

This project implements a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory using Verilog, along with a complete SystemVerilog testbench to verify its functionality.

Features of the FIFO

32-depth FIFO (fifo[31:0])

8-bit data width

Independent read and write pointers

Full & Empty flag generation

Synchronous read and write operations

Resettable pointers and output

Safe read/write protection using r_en and w_en signals
