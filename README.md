**FIFO Design in Verilog with SystemVerilog Testbench**

This project implements a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory using Verilog, along with a complete SystemVerilog testbench to verify its functionality.

**Features of the FIFO**<br>

1.32-depth FIFO (fifo[31:0]) <br>
2.8-bit data width<br>
3.Independent read and write pointers<br>
4.Full & Empty flag generation<br>
5.Synchronous read and write operations<br>
6.Resettable pointers and output<br>
7.Safe read/write protection using r_en and w_en signals<br>
